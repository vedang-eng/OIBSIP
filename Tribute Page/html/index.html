        <P class="w-50" style="text-align: justify;">

            Pel√© made his international debut in 1957 at age 16 and the following year played his first game in the
            World Cup finals in Sweden. The Brazilian manager was initially hesitant to play his young star. When Pel√©
            finally reached the field, he had an immediate impact, rattling the post with one shot and collecting an
            assist. He had a hat trick in the semifinal against France and two goals in the championship game, where
            Brazil defeated Sweden 5-2. At the 1962 World Cup finals, Pel√© tore a thigh muscle in the second match and
            had to sit out the remainder of the tournament. Nonetheless, Brazil went on to claim its second World Cup
            title.
            Rough play and injuries turned the 1966 World Cup into a disaster for both Brazil and Pel√©, as the
            team went out in the first round, and he contemplated retiring from World Cup play. Returning in 1970 for
            one more World Cup tournament, he teamed with young stars Jairzinho and Rivelino to claim Brazil‚Äôs third
            title and permanent ownership of the Jules Rimet Trophy. Pel√© finished his World Cup career having scored 12
            goals in 14 games.

                    <p style="text-align: justify;">
                        The exact number of goals Pele scored in his career is a matter of dispute and figures vary,
                        but he is reported to have found the net over 1,000 times.

                        According to FIFA's official website, Pele scored 1,281 goals in 1,363 games, but it must be
                        noted that this figure includes data from a significant number of unofficial matches, such
                        as friendly tours with Santos and the New York Cosmos. Guinness World Records, meanwhile,
                        state that Pele scored 1,289 times in 1,363 matches.

                        The bulk of Pele's goals were scored for Santos, where he spent the majority of his career.
                        He scored 643 goals for Santos in 656 competitive appearances. He netted 64 strikes in 107
                        games for the New York Cosmos.

                        <br>

                        The Rec Sport Soccer Statistics Foundation (RSSSF) reported that Pele's official goal tally -
                        based on competitive matches only - was 767 goals in 831 games, though their overall (including
                        unofficial games) tally varies from the others too, putting the Brazilian at 1,284 strikes in
                        1,375 fixtures.

                    <p style="text-align: justify;">
                        Pele played at four World Cups and was part of three winning Brazil teams: in 1958, 1962 and
                        1970.

                        The striker exploded onto the scene at the 1958 World Cup in Sweden, playing a pivotal role as
                        the Selecao clinched their first ever world title.

                        Brazil won the World Cup again in 1962 in Chile, but Pele's influence at that tournament was
                        unfortunately limited due to an injury sustained early in the campaign.

                        They could not defend their title at the 1966 World Cup as hosts England sealed glory, but
                        reclaimed the crown in 1970, with Pele - an elder statesman among a cast of exciting stars -
                        winning the Golden Ball.

                    <p style="text-align: justify;">
                        Pele scored 77 goals for Brazil in 92 appearances. He is the joint-top goalscorer of all time
                        for Brazil, alongside modern superstar Neymar, who matched his tally at the 2022 World Cup.

                        He scored his first goal for his country in 1957 in a 2-1 defeat against Argentina in Rio de
                        Janeiro and continued to find the net regularly through the late 1950s, 1960s and into the
                        1970s.

                        Of Pele's 77 goals, 12 were scored in World Cups, with his biggest tally for a single tournament
                        being six in the successful 1958 campaign.

                        His last goal for Brazil came in a 1971 friendly match against Austria in Sao Paulo, which ended
                        1-1.
